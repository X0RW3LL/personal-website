# OSCP

In this chapter, I will be going through my general experience with OSCP. Expect nothing technical; this is more of a storytime type of entry, focusing on the personal aspect. If you want to learn more about the technicalities, there's PEN-200, exam guide, and FAQs for that

This is only meant to be a light read, and I'm pretty much known for talking a lot. Divines watch over you as you read through my ramblings and try to make sense thereof

Additionally, this is my _personal_ reflection on my own journey, so YMMV. This is not a guide, or an instruction manual; it is simply thoughts streamed out from my brain, through a keyboard, wired into a laptop, encoded into binary data, travelling hundreds or thousands of miles in huge underwater cables, to be delivered to your computer, decoded all the way back to human-readable form so you can read it and go, "get a load of this guy". Enjoy, or don't; completely up to you!
