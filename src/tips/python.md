# Python

## Introduction

Love it or hate it, Python can be very powerful for a wide variety of tasks. From simple scripting to full-blown complex programming, Python's got you covered.

While I started off with Python as a first language, I wouldn't recommend it as a first for anyone else. There are key concepts that Python gets to..._masquerade_ from you. However, we're not here to trash-talk Python's shortcomings; that's left as an exercise for the reader at their own discretion and preference. We are here to cover some ground to make Python even more friendlier to the absolute beginner

## Assumptions

- This entry assumes _some_ working knowledge with Python. You're not expected to know how to program an entire server application to be able to follow along, but rather be familiar with the basics; variables, functions, and so on
- Python version: 3.12.9 (at the time of writing)

## What you need

- A computer, obv; this isn't the 1800s, hey
- Python interpreter
- Text editor

## What we'll cover

- [The infamous Traceback (most recent call last)](python/traceback.md)
- [Getting help()](python/getting_help.md)
- [Finding and installing Python packages correctly](python/installing_packages.md)
- [Handling externally-managed Python packages with virtual environments](python/venv.md)
